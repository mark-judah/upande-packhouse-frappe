"""Dashboard (Connections) override for Stock Entry.

Roses move through the packhouse as a chain of Stock Entries: one or more
Harvesting / Grading entries feed a single Receiving entry. Each harvest/grading
entry stores its Receiving entry in ``custom_receiving_entry`` (a self-referential
Link on Stock Entry). This override surfaces that relationship in the Connections
tab so that from a Receiving entry you can see every harvest/grading entry that
fed it — the reverse direction of the ``custom_receiving_entry`` link field.
